# Open Source Cheat Sheets

## Become a contributor
Either open a pull request with the changes you want,
open an issue asking to become a contributor,
or drop a message in the OSCS thread in the Mac CS 2025 Discord.

## Local Setup (Recommended)
1. [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. [Install LaTeX Locally](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)
3. [Install LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop)

## Overleaf Setup
1. Become a contributor (see above)
2. Create a new project in Overleaf, and pick "Import from GitHub"
3. When you want to push/pull changes, use the Overleaf menu and select GitHub, under Sync. \
(I have no idea how well Overleaf handles merge conflicts,
which is why I recommend using the local setup above.)
