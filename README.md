## (Anticipated) FAQs

### Where's the sheets for year 1?
I used separate Overleaf documents for courses in 1st year, so they haven't been added to the repo.
If you'd really want to see them here, bug me on Discord.

### I worked on this when it was still on Overleaf. Why is my contribution not credited?
Sadly, Overleaf's sync process doesn't transfer over contributor details.
(I'm as dissapointed as you, I literally couldn't have done this without the community)
If you don't plan on contributing through GitHub but still want your name attached to the project,
please DM me on Discord and I'll add your name to this README.
