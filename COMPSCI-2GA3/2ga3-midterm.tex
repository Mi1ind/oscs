	\section{Logic Basics}
	% \subsection{Physics}
	% \textbf{Ohm's Law:} $R = \frac{U}{T}$\\
	% \textbf{Series:} \\
	% $R_T = \sum_{i=1}^N R_i$ \\
	% $V_T = \sum_{i=1}^N V_i$ \\
	% $I_T = I_1 = I_2 = \dots = I_N$\\
	% \textbf{Parallel:} \\
	% $1/R = \sum_{i=1}^N (1/R_i)$\\

	% $I_T = \sum_{i=1}^N I_i$ \\

	\subsection{Transistors}
	MOSFETs have 4 components: Source, Gate, Drain, and Base

	\textbf{PNP/NMOS:} Is on when gate is positive. No circle. \\
	\textbf{NPN/PMOS:} Is on when gate is negative. Has circle.

	Generally, transistors are used to pull the output to either
	a positive voltage, or a zero voltage (1 or 0, on or off).
	If output is not pulled to one of these,
	the output is floating and is indeterminate in voltage.

	\subsubsection{Adders}
	Left: Half-adder. Right: Full-adder.
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{half-adder.png} \\
		\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{full-adder.png} \\
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{n-adder.png}
	\end{center}
	% REVIEW: Is there anything else that needs to be added here?
	Unlike half-adders, full-adders can recieve carry-in bits.
	To add more bits, chain multiple full-adders together.
	If final carry at end is 1, there's an overflow error.

	\subsubsection{Latches \& Flip-flops}
	\textbf{Flip-flop}
	Every time the input switches from 0 to 1, the output switches to
	the opposite.
	% TODO: Add more detail about flip-flops

	\textbf{Gated D-latch} \\

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Q - The stored bit
		\item D - Data/bit to write to Q
		\item E - The enabler (Must be 1 to enable writing, otherwise nothing changes)
		\item Operate on the principle of propagation delay.
		\item Stacking many of them can be used to create a register:
	\end{itemize}

	% REVIEW: Do we need this?
	% seems like a lot of space dedicated to something that's trivial to derive
	% from scratch
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{register.png}

	\subsection{Counters}
	For each transition from \textbf{low to high}, the counter increments
	the binary output by 1. (Counting the transition from high to low does
	the same thing, but the lecture used rising-edge counters).

	\subsection{Propagation Delay}
	The rate at which a transistor switches. Typical 100 ps (picoseconds)
	\subsection{Decoders}
	Take in an $n$-bit number, and turn on one of $2^n$ outputs.

	\subsection{Feedback Loops}
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Feedback_loop.png}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Counter increments each time the clock changes from 0 to 1
		\item Decoder moves to the next instruction each time
		\item Stop sends a signal back to the and gate which stops counter
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Multiplexer / Demultiplexer}
	\textbf{Multiplexer} turns $n$ signals into a single signal. Chooses
	which signal to let through. \textbf{Demultiplexer} turns a single signal
	into $n$ signals. The single signal chooses which signal to output.

	\subsection{Software vs Hardware Design}
	Unlike software, which uses iteration, hardware uses replication. The advantages of replication are increased elegance, higher speed, and increased reliability.
	Hardware also uses gate minimization, abstraction and power optimization.

	\subsection{Fixed \& Programmable Logic}
	\textbf{Fixed logic circuits:} Pre-determined function.
	\textbf{Programmable logic:} FPGAs (reprogrammable, but still a significant cost to switching functions).
	\textbf{Stored program and re-programmable circuits:} Your computer right now.
	\section{Data Encoding}
	1 Byte = 8 bits.
	1 \textbf{Byte} encodes a character, integer, or pointer.
	1 \textbf{Word} is $n$ bytes, determined by the architecture.

	\subsection{Converting between bases}
	\textbf{Base 10 to Base N}
	Divide decimal \# by \# of new base.
	Take remainder as rightmost digit.
	Divide quotient of previous divide by new base.
	Repeat until quotient is zero.
	\textbf{Base N to Base 10}
	Take each column position of each digit, zero indexed, as $n$.
	For each column, do $c \cdot b^n$, where $c$ is the value of the column,
	and $b$ is the base value in base 10.

	\textbf{Important bases table}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}[!ht]{@{}lll@{}}
			\toprule
			Hex & Bin  & Dec \\
			\midrule
			0   & 0000 & 0   \\
			1   & 0001 & 1   \\

			3   & 0011 & 3   \\
			4   & 0100 & 4   \\
			5   & 0101 & 5   \\
			6   & 0110 & 6   \\
			7   & 0111 & 7   \\
			\bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
		\begin{tabular}[!ht]{@{}lll@{}}

			E   & 1110 & 14  \\
			F   & 1111 & 15  \\
			\bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}

	\subsection{Fraction to Binary}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Let $x$ be the decimal part of our fraction.
		\item Let $b$ be our binary output.
		\item Multiply $x$ by 2.
		\item If $x \ge 1$, subtract 1 from $x$ and append 1 to $b$.
		\item If $x < 1$, append 0 to $b$.
		\item Goto step 3 until $x != 0$.
	\end{enumerate}

	\subsection{Signed Integers}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Two's complement:} Flip all bits, add 1.
		      Range is $-(2^{n-1}), +(2^{n-1} - 1)$
		\item \textbf{Sign-magnitude:} First bit is sign, rest is magnitude.
		      Range is $-(2^{n-1} - 1), +(2^{n-1} - 1)$.
		\item \textbf{One's complement:} Flip all bits.
		      Eg, +6 is $0110$, so to get -6 go from $0110 \to 1001 \to 1010$.
				This has 2 zero, positive and negative zero.
		      Range is $-(2^{n-1} - 1), +(2^{n-1} - 1)$.
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Cast from Ints}
	You might want to cast a lets say 8 bit int, to a 16 bit int. How you do that? \\
	\textbf{sign-magnitude}: Copy the MSB to the bigger ints MSB. Then take the remaining bits and fill them from the right to left. \\
	\textbf{one's complement and two's complement}: 
	Copy the Lowest order bits (the bits except the sign defining bit) and copy them to the other ints lowest order bits. \\
	Take the MSB and make all the remaining bits in the new int the MSB.
	\subsection{IEEE-754 Floats}
	Can represent values from $2^{-126}$ to $2^{127}$ which is $10^{-38}$ to $10^{38}$ in decimal.
	If double precision is used then the range is $2^{-1022}$ to $2^{1023}$ which is $10^{-308}$ to $10^{308}$ in decimal.
	Separated into \textbf{sign, exponent, and mantissa}.
	Entire float is represented in binary, and the exponent is biased by $2^{b-1} - 1$,
	where $b$ is the number of exponent bits.
	Leading 1 is dropped from mantissa.
	To calculate from IEEE, do $1.(m_2) \times 2^{(e_2)}$.
	(Convert out of base 2 first).
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{ieee-754.png}

	\subsubsection{Special Values}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}[!ht]{@{}cc|c@{}}
			\toprule
			Exponent & Mantissa   & Value        \\
			\midrule
			all 1s   & all 0s     & $\pm \infty$ \\
			all 1s   & not all 0s & NaN          \\
			all 0s   & not all 0s & denormalized \\
			all 0s   & all 0s     & $\pm 0$      \\
			\bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}

	\subsection{Binary-coded decimals}
	Instead of representing decimals using a float,
	use an arbitrarily long string of bytes, usually as binary ints.
	Efficiency can be improved using packed BCDs, by putting 2 ints in one byte
	(each digit occupying a nibble).
	\verb|0x2D| is used by the textbook to represent a negative, placed at the end of the BCD.
	For a packed BCD, drop the 2.

	\subsection{Endianess}
	\textbf{Endian:} The way in which words(group of bytes) are stored in memory.
	\textbf{Big Endian:} Most significant byte first.
	\textbf{Little Endian:} Least significant byte first.
	Little endian is the most common method of storing data in memory.
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{endianness.png}
	\subsection{ASCII and Unicode}
	\textbf{ASCII:} 128 characters, 7 bits.
	\textbf{Unicode:} 1,114,112 characters, 21 bits. Has variable length encoding for optimization i.e has as many bytes as needed.
	\subsection{Unicode Encoding}
	\includegraphics*[width=\linewidth]{unicode.png}



	\subsection{Types of architecture}
	\textbf{Von Neumann architecture (left):}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Single memory block which contains both instructions and data.
		\item Offers complete flexibility: at any time, owner can change how much of the memory is devoted to programs and how much to data.
		\item More popular.
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Harvard architecture (right):}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 2 separate memory. One is used for instruction, one is used for data.
		\item Inflexible, as you cannot use part of the instructional memory to store data and vise versa.
		\item Less popular. Sometimes used in small embedded systems.
	\end{itemize}
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{vn-arch.png}
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{harvard-arch.png}
	\subsubsection{Von Neumann Bottleneck}
	On computers running Von Neumann Architecture, time spent accessing memory can limit performance.
	To avoid the bottleneck, designs are chosen where operands are moved to registers instead of system memory.

	\subsection{Types of processors}

	\textbf{Categories based on logic:} \\
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Fixed logic}: Function fixed in hardware, performs a single task
		\item \textbf{Selectable logic}: Choose one of several fixed functions.
		\item \textbf{Parametrizable logic}: Accepts a set of parameters that control the computation of fixed functions.
		\item \textbf{Programmable logic}: list of instructions provided at runtime (you can code them)
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Categories based on Complexity:} \\
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Co-processors}: Dedicated function. Usually performs a single task at high speed. Used in -> Floating point accelerator. Fixed/Selectable logic.
		\item \textbf{Microcontrollers}: Direct hardware control. Used in -> Elevator doors. Programmable logic.
		\item \textbf{Embedded System Processors}: real-time OS, dedicated hardware. usually more powerful than microcontrollers. Used in -> smart phone Programmable logic.
		\item \textbf{General-purpose Processors}: compatible for multiple systems. Used in -> CPU in a PC. Programmable logic.
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Parts of a processor}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Controller}: Responsible for program execution. Steps through the program and coordinates the actions of all other units.
		\item \textbf{Arithmetic logic unit}: Performs all computational tasks. Performs one operation at a time according to controller.
		\item \textbf{Local storage (registers)}: Hold data values such as operands for arithmetic operations and the result.
		\item \textbf{Internal connections}: Transfers data values between units, like from local storage to the ALU. AKA data paths/Bus/Control lines
		\item \textbf{External interface}: Handles all communication between the processor and the rest of the computer system.
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Fetch execute cycle}
	There is a \textbf{instruction pointer} which moves through the program performing every step. The cycle never ends while the system is runing.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Fetch the next instruction
		\item Decode the instruction and fetch operands from registers
		\item Perform the arithmetic operation specified by the \textbf{opcode}
		\item Perform memory read or write, if needed
		\item Store the result back to the registers
		\item go to next instruction, Repeat forever.
	\end{enumerate}

	\subsection{Program Translation}
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{program-translation.png}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Preprocessor:} Expands macros, producing modified source program.
		\item \textbf{Compiler:} Translates it to assembly.
		\item \textbf{Assembler:} Translates it to relocatable object code which contains references to external library functions.
		\item \textbf{Linker:} Replaces external function references with its code.
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{CISC vs RISC}
	\textbf{CISC}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Each instruction performs a complex operation
		\item Instructions may take multiple clock cycles
		\item Fewer instruction calls
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{RISC}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Each instruction performs a simple operation
		\item Instructions all take the same number of clock cycles
		\item Many instruction calls needed
		\item Allows for pipelining, as each part of the instruction takes the same amount of time
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Pipelines}
	Allow for more than one instruction to be ``processed'' at the same time.
	Generally 5 stages:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Fetch next instruction
		\item decode \& fetch operands
		\item perform arithmetic operation
		\item read or write memory
		\item store result
	\end{enumerate}

	\subsubsection{Pipeline Stalls}
	Also known as hazards. 3 main types:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		      \textbf{Data Hazards:} Waiting for data from an earlier instruction.
		      Can be dealt with using data forwarding (allowing data to be used
		      before it exits the pipeline), re-arranging instruction order.
		\item
		      \textbf{Control Hazards:} Incorrect instruction is in the pipeline.
		      Occurs during jump instructions/branching. Jumps are not executed
		      until the fifth stage, so instructions directly after are fetched
		      inside the pipeline.  Can be dealt with using conditional branch
		      prediction, flushing pipeline if prediction is wrong.
		\item
		      \textbf{Structural Hazards:} Resource conflict (usually from external
		      source) (eg sombody else is accessing the same register bank). Can
		      be dealt with by loading data in parallel, eg using multiple banks.
	\end{itemize}
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{stall-example.png}

	\subsection{Branching}
	Moving the instruction pointer to a different location in program.
	Can be either absolute branch, or relative branch.
	% REVIEW: idk what else needs to be added here,
	% this seems pretty trivial

	\section{Instruction Sets}
	Generally has the following parts:
	Operation number, registers, offset.
   \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Opcode}: Specifies the operation to be performed.
      \item \textbf{Registers}: Specifies the operands and the destination.
      \item \textbf{Offset}: Specifies the address of the data to be operated on.
   \end{itemize}
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{isa-example.png}

	\subsection{Opcodes}
	AKA operation code.
	A binary number indicating which instruction to run.
	Statically assigned when the instruction set was designed.

	\subsection{Design choices}
	\subsubsection{Encoding length}
	\textbf{Variable-length} encoding can improve instruction density,
	but \textbf{fixed-length} instructions are simpler to implement in hardware,
	and are thus more performant. Unused bits are ignored by the instruction.

	Offsets are used to encode immediate values (generally used for jumping).

	\subsubsection{Number of Operands}
	\textbf{Zero operands:} Stack architecture, using push and pop. All operands are implicit.
	\textbf{One operand:} Implicit destination (usually a special accumulator register)
	\textbf{Two operands:} Specified destination, but uniary operations (eg \verb|add rA, rB #rA=rA+rB|)
	\textbf{Three operands:} Specified destination, binary operations
	TL;DR, more operands = more flexible instructions, but more space taken up by operands

	\subsubsection{Implicit vs Explicit Encoding}
	\textbf{Implicit Encoding:} Operand types are always the same for a given opcode.
	Different opcodes are used for different types.
	\textbf{Explicit Encoding:} Operand field specifies what type of operands are being provided.

	\subsubsection{Operand Adressing Modes}
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{operand-addressing-modes.png}

	\subsubsection{Orthogonality}
	Each instruction should perform a \textit{unique task},
	without duplicating or overlapping the functionality of other instructions.
	Advantages: Orthogonal instructions can be understood more easily,
	and programmers don't need to pick between functions that perform the same task.

	\subsection{Registers}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		      \textbf{General Registers}:
		      Fixed size (usually 32 or 64 bits), 2 basic ops, fetch and store.
		      Numbered from 0 to $N-1$.
		\item
		      \textbf{Floating Point Registers}:
		      Separate set of registers holding floats, but numbering overlaps.
		      Floating point registers are automatically used if instruction requires FP.
		\item
		      \textbf{Special Registers}:
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item
			            \textbf{Program Counter (\textit{pc})} - Stores the address of the
			            next instruction to fetch.
			      \item
			            \textbf{Comparer (\textit{cmp})} - Stores the result of the last
			            comparison operation. (1 for true, 0 for false).
			      \item
			            \textbf{Accumulator (\textit{acc})} - For zero and one-operand
			            architectures to store the result of the last command.
		      \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Subroutines and Register Windows}
	When calling a subroutine, registers in use will partially shift down,
	making some of them unaccessible, some new registers available,
	and keeping some between both calls.
	This allows for values to be passed to and from the subroutine,
	while keeping some values separated.
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{register-windows.png}

	\subsubsection{Register Banks}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item Allows parallel access within same clock cycle -> efficiency
      \item Some operations require operands from banks
      \item Register bank conflicts
   \end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Register Conflicts}
	Accessing 2 registers from the same bank simultaneously causes a register conflict.
	Best case, it causes a stall in the pipeline. Worst case, it causes the system to crash. \\
   \subsubsection{Solution}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item reassign
      \item moving registers
      \item insert an instruction to copy values to the opposite register.
   \end{itemize}

	\section{Physical Implementation}
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{data-paths.png}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Core loop between M1, 32-bit pgm. ctr., 32-bit adder
		\item Instruction memory returns instruction at given address
		\item Instruction decoder takes instruction and decodes it into individual parts
		\item Register fields used to select registers used in instructions, register unit takes fields and returns contents
		\item M2 Multiplexer takes auxiliary adding functions (such as adding an offset) and passes it through ALU
		\item ALU performs operation. For addresses, it's passed directly to data memory to get data out,
		      for operations, data is passed to multiplexer to be stored into register for future use.
	\end{itemize}
\end{multicols*}
